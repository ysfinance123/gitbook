# Introducing Aniza NFT

![A sneak peek at Aniza](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\*96mQk6dGtTTjqV4O)

We are thrilled to announce that Yellow Submarine’s Aniza NFT collection will be live soon! The team has been preparing for a long time to provide our early community members with a distinct reward symbolic of Yellow Submarine’s creative innovations. The Aniza NFTs are here to reward you for your support.

Anizas are water dragons that enjoy hunting for treasure in the ocean’s depths. Often called “Nessies” or Loch Ness Monsters, they have a mythical origin tied to the planet Nibiru. They are a symbol of imagination of the whole community. Their penchant for treasure hunting is similar to many people’s crypto journey, always looking for the next opportunity.

We think that the Web3 world is fantastic and people’s imaginations can become reality. The Aniza or Nessie might be imaginary, but we bring it to the real world through Yellow Submarine. It symbolizes a real change that we can bring to the real world through Web3 and the blockchain, just as Yellow Submarine brings privacy to Ethereum and DeFi world.

## About Aniza <a href="#e51a" id="e51a"></a>

Aniza is the NFT of Yellow Submarine built on the Ethereum blockchain. There will be a maximum supply of 10,000 NFTs, with 8,000 normal Anizas, 1,600 rare Anizas, and 400 legendary Anizas. We’ll be giving away a certain number in our “Treasure Diving” Campaign to encourage user testing of Yellow Submarine’s private transaction beta.

## Exploring the legendary voyage of Anizas <a href="#c09e" id="c09e"></a>

Long, long ago, Loch Ness was part of the North Atlantic Ocean. The Loch Ness monsters followed the Anunnaki from Nibiru (also known as **Planet** Nine or **Planet** X) to Earth, a mysterious creature with invisibility. After the Anunnaki were defeated in a great battle with the Earthlings and went to the bottom of the sea, most of the Nessies were brought into the core of the sea to guard and fight for treasures of the Anunnaki.

“This sea belongs to me, stand and deliver, unless you are a pretty lady”, Anizas who guarded the shallow sea said to the intruders with weapons in their hands. Anizas with different levels are stationed in different depths of the sea, so their resistance and politeness grows.

Ocean treasure hunting is an exciting process. Anizas can enjoy swimming to the bottom of the ocean, exploring the unknown deep-sea areas, catching all kinds of fish and shellfish, and collecting various materials. But you can only reach a limited depth according to the equipment you have, but of course, you will also find some scattered supplies in various areas, including weapons, clothing, diving suits, oxygen masks. The accumulation of these equipment will help you upgrade your identity, so that you can fight with the same level of the Aniza, so as to find the treasure earlier.

You may be fighting with different Anizas for equipment and treasure, while female Anizas may become your mate. “My dear, I will take you to the real place of hidden treasure. Hope you and your yellow submarine can withstand the next test.”

## The levels of Aniza <a href="#ab85" id="ab85"></a>

Aniza consists of 3 different levels: Normal, Rare, and Legendary. Their weapons and equipment vary according to different levels, with unique skill and style. All Anizas are powerful, but some enjoy higher levels of rarity than others. Higher-level Anizas enjoy more powerful equipment types.
