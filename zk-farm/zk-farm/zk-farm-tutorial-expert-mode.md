# ZK Farm Tutorial (Expert Mode)

Expert mode means more professional and private on-chain transactions, mainly by setting a fixed **Discrete amount** and **Random Delay** of transactions to ensure the privacy of transaction details.

## Discrete amount:

“Expert Mode” using a specified **Discrete amount** that allows multiple transactions to operate at the same amount,such as 100, 1000,10000,etc., the details of the transaction cannot be inferred from the amount on the chain.

## Random Delay:

Under the specified **Discrete amount**, a random extension of time allows multiple transfers to be initiated at the same time or approximately at the same time, preventing others from inferring transaction information by comparing initiation and arrival times. It's a guarantee of privacy.

**Random delay is optional, and you can deselect this option if you feel the wait time is too long.**
