# zk-Farm

Yellow Submarine innovatively launched the first optional privacy Staking Function, which encrypts the identity of the staking in privacy.

## What is zk-Farm？

Transaction originators can use the zkFarm feature to make privacy staking for payee, which will encrypt the identity of the transaction originator, meaning that in the future you may receive a transfer without knowing who the sender is. ZkFarm can be used in either normal mode or Expert Mode.

Yellow Submarine Farm integrates Curve, Beefy, Compound and other well-known DeFi protocols. Users can choose to withdraw the profits obtained from the pledge with original platform value tokens such as CRV, USDT, USDC, etc., effectively reducing the risk of users' erratic loss.

Yellow Submarine provides users with the strategy of automatic reinvestment, which eliminates the need for manual reinvestment, thus reducing the expenditure of Gas and further improving users' pledge income.

## zk-Farm Advantages

### 1. Lower risk

Select the underlying pools or protocols with the highest liquidity and yield on each chain to serve as our underlying farms or strategies, with the aim of maximizing the reduction of impermanent loss risk and providing stable and high returns.

2\. Automatic compound interest

Provide an automatic compounding strategy for all tokens staked on the platform, eliminating the need for liquidity providers to worry about manual compounding fees, thereby further reducing operating costs.

### 3. Real-time monitor

Continuously track and monitor each underlying pool on each chain 24/7, automatically replacing underlying pools or optimizing strategies in advance to avoid liquidity shortages and prevent various extreme "black swan" events.

### 4. High Reward

Farm returns are divided into compounding rewards and staking rewards. Liquidity providers will share 50% of the underlying protocol's compounding rewards with the platform for reinvestment. The form of return of this reward token depends on the farm where the liquidity provider is located. This behavior maximizes the reduction of impermanent loss risk and eliminates concerns about liquidity depth. At the same time, liquidity providers can also receive staking rewards (the platform's mining revenue). This mining revenue will be rewarded in the form of YES tokens, and the high staking APY ensures that overall returns for liquidity providers remain in a higher range.
