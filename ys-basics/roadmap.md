### Private Vaults&#x20;

YS Private Vaults allow users to deposit assets held across different chains in private vaults. Private vaults are essentially “private” wallets to hold tokens without revealing all information. This means transfers in (and out of) private vaults are structured so that the sender and receiver address, amount, and asset type of a transaction are not revealed to the public. Users can store tokens in their private vaults indefinitely or move tokens from their private vaults back to a regular transparent wallet at their discretion. Storage of tokens in private vaults will unlock innovative new types of DeFi integrations and additional UX choices for various use cases such as private staking derivatives.
