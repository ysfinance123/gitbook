# Supported Assets and Networks

Currently, there are many existing cross-chain interoperability solutions under challenges related to low liquidity, which ultimately impacts the user experience. These solutions aim to facilitate transfers of assets across different chains but the lack of sufficient liquidity on these interoperability platforms can lead to delays, slippage, and overall inefficiencies.&#x20;

Yellow Submarine (YS) addresses this issue by prioritizing privacy-preserving transfers on each supported chain to accumulate liquidity through staking rewards. Once the liquidity depth on a chain reaches a certain threshold, cross-chain transfer will be supported, supporting seamless cross-chain privacy transfers. Additionally, by combining staking and cross-chain transfers, YS allows compliant & private cross-chain staking.

Through its commitment to liquidity depth and the integration of privacy, transfers, and staking, Yellow Submarine strives to provide an improved user experience and drive the adoption of cross-chain privacy transactions.
