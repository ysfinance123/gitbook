# About Yellow Submarine (YS)

## What is Yellow Submarine (YS)&#x20;

Yellow Submarine (YS) is a pioneering multi-chain privacy solution, offering a plug-and-play, privacy-as-a-service for an array of Web3 applications. Leveraging advanced ZKP technologies, it empowers developers with the ability to integrate privacy-preserving features into their applications, thus enhancing maintains validity of transactions while safeguarding transaction confidentiality. Today, YS supports major assets on major EVM chains, serving as the industry's first paradigm for a web3 trustless privacy layer.&#x20;



Yellow Submarine V1 accommodates two primary functionalities: [zk-Transfer](broken-reference) and [zk-Farm](broken-reference) functionalities. Both processes are simplified for users and can be completed using MetaMask within a few clicks.&#x20;

* **`zk-Transfer`** enables users to easily transfer supported assets (on the same chain or cross different chains) privately, effectively obscuring the tracking of public addresses and transactions to uphold the highest standards of privacy.
* **`zk-Farm`** allows transaction initiators to engage in privacy staking for payees. This process encrypts the identity of the staker, enabling transactions where the recipient might receive a transfer without knowing the sender's identity. &#x20;

In addition, Yellow Submarine introduces an "Expert Mode" for advanced users seeking more professional and private on-chain transactions. This mode offers a fixed Discrete amount and Random Delay for transactions.

For developers, YS SDK offers a seamless integration process to dapps which is highly flexible and scalable. Additionally, they can leverage the existing zk-Farm offered by the YS protocol for optimized staking returns. With Yellow Submarine, developers can efficiently build and deploy privacy-preserving solutions, fostering the growth of the decentralized web while maintaining user privacy and confidentiality.

## Why Use Yellow Submarine&#x20;

**Enhancing Privacy**: At its core, Yellow Submarine offers an adaptable and highly extensible privacy-enhancing service layer, compatible with a broad array of blockchains, tokens, and dApps. Its state-of-the-art architecture allows for the low-cost addition of use cases. Established dApps like Compound can be seamlessly integrated with Yellow Submarine via the YS SDK. &#x20;

**Privacy Across Chains**: Yellow Submarine excels over single-chain privacy solutions by ensuring privacy across both single and multi-chain transactions, including interoperability with centralized entities like CEXes. It stands as an efficient, low-cost bridge for multi-chain cross-chain transactions, with privacy enhancement as an added value feature.

**Simplified Integration**: Yellow Submarine is an easy-to-use integration that eliminates the need for users to switch between different tools or portals, or to configure complex parameters or CLIs. It offers a range of functionalities in a few simple clicks. Yellow Submarine also serves as a multi-chain dApp portal for private payments, private launchpad, private banking, and more, showcasing its potential for numerous use cases.

**Cost-Effective Privacy**: Unlike traditional layer-one-chain privacy solutions, Yellow Submarineâ€™s zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) operations are natively executed on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based sidechain, providing in higher efficiency and lower gas costs. This makes Yellow Submarine one of the most cost-effective choices for privacy transactions.
