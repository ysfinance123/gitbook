[**`Yellow Submarine Gateway`**](broken-reference) is a private multi-chain portal/gateway for DeFi applications. Its first proof-of-concept implementation, `YS Gateway Transactor`, is a privacy-preserving cross-chain transactor protocol where users can transfer supported assets from one chain to another without leaving fully publicly-linkable traces. YS Gateway can be plugged into any existing DeFi application on Ethereum and its satellite networks; we are actively working on integrations with major DeFi protocols and NFT projects.

[**`Yellow Submarine Connect SDK`**](broken-reference) is a set of SDK for DeFi developers to integrate with YS's privacy-boosting features programmatically into their own web portals of dApps. It provides a simple API for more developers to utilize Yellow Submarine's cross-chain privacy support in a plug-n-play manner.
