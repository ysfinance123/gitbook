# Compliance Tools

Yellow Submarine is designed from day zero with compliance into consideration. It provides several innovative ways which were combined to provide an easy compliance experience for users. The privacy we support is legal privacy. We support the well-being of our users without harming others. It is the cornerstone of the value system of Yellow Submarine. We have a strong faith that this value will generate a more sustainable gain for YS users and YS stakeholders as well. The compliance tools provided by Yellow Submarine includes but are not limited to:

### ZKP-enabled asset tracing for audibility

Yellow Submarine's sidechain supports auditable privacy-preserving assets using SNARK-friendly hybrid encryption and advanced Zero-knowledge Proof technologies such as Matrix sigma and Binary-checking-friendly TurboPlonk.

### Soul-bound token based KYC and transfer limit system

Users with certain soul-bound tokens will be considered as having passed certain levels of KYC. This mechanism provides a flexible transfer limit system which allows users to select the level of KYC to pass and therefore increase the limits of their transfer amount.

### Off-chain compliance risk analysis and reaction system

Yellow Submarine has built an off-chain indexing service that can monitor Yellow Submarine related transactions on source chains and destination chains in a multichain environment. It provides useful information for both the compliance risk analysis and the security of the system.

### Token-issuer level compliance interfaces

Yellow Submarine allows ERC-20 tokens with compliance interfaces in the EVM-compatible realm and provides similar compliance tool interfaces when the tokens are converted to shielded tokens on Yellow Submarine's sidechain.
