# Fee Structure

The Fee structure for a zk-Transfer consists of three parts: protocol fee, base fee and the gas fee. A zk-Transfer involves five steps: deposit, convert ysUSDT to shielded ysUSDT, zk-Transfer, deshielding shielded ysUSDT to ysUSDT, and withdraw.

During steps 1 and 5, users need to pay standard **Gas Fee** in AVAX for depositing into and withdrawing assets from the YS smart contract.&#x20;

In addition there is also the fee to cover YS Chain's operations, which is charged in ysUSDT tokens (the token being transferred). The **Protocol Fee** is charged as a percentage of the transfer amount as a commission. The **Base Fee** covers the cost for smart contract operations on the YS chain. This way users only need to hold two types of tokens for a zk-Transfer, the transferred token and the native token of the chain.&#x20;

While it may sound complicated, as a user, you will see the gas estimate for AVAX and ysUSDT (custom spending cap) before you sign the transaction on MetaMask. In most cases, the estimated cost of a zk-Transfer in terms of USD value is around $3 under Easy Mode and around $4 under Expert Mode.
