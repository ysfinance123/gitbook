# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» ZK Transfer Tutorial (Expert Mode)

In "Expert Mode," you can engage in more professional and private on-chain transactions by setting a fixed **Discrete Amount** and **Random Delay**. To perform a ZK Transfer using this mode, follow the steps below:

1. Go to YS testnet page and connect your MetaMask wallet, configure to the Avalanche testnet.

3. Input the transfer details for your ZK Transfer.&#x20;

* In "Expert Mode," you can choose from specified Discrete amounts such as 100, 1000, 10000, etc. You must select one of the Discrete Amounts displayed on the page for the trade.
* By default, "Expert Mode" automatically selects the "Random delay" option. This introduces a delay in the transaction to enhance privacy. If you find the wait time too long, you have the option to deselect this feature.
