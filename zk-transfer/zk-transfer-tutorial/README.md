# ZK Transfer Tutorial

Yellow Submarine V1 introduces robust privacy capabilities for single-chain transactions on popular blockchains like ETH, Avalanche, and Polygon. zk-Transfer supports private transfers on a single chain, obfuscating the connection between the sender and receiver's address(es) - this means that the transaction details, including the amount and participants, will not be visible on the public ledger or accessible through block explorers.&#x20;

In this user tutorial, we will provide a demonstration of Yellow Submarine's single-chain zk-Transfer using the Avalanche testnet. Please note that the demo specifically supports private transfers for ysUSDT on the Avalanche testnet. Once Yellow Submarine is launched on the Mainnet, it will extend its support to the "official" USDT tokens and various other tokens. Let's dive in and explore the seamless privacy offered by Yellow Submarine on the Avalanche testnet.

If you don't have the Avalanche C-Chain testnet configured in your wallet, you'll need to follow the Network Configuration steps before proceeding with the zk-Transfer tutorial. &#x20;
