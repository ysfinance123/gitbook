# Expert Mode

Expert Mode in Yellow Submarine refers to an advanced and privacy-oriented approach to on-chain transactions. It leverages two key features: **Discrete Amount** and **Random Delay**.

Discrete Amount: In Expert Mode, transactions are conducted using a fixed Discrete amount. This allows for multiple transactions to be executed at the same amount, such as 100, 1000, 10000, etc. By employing a specific Discrete amount, the transaction details cannot be inferred solely from the displayed amount on the blockchain. This enhances privacy and confidentiality, providing users with a more secure transaction experience.

Random Delay: Expert Mode also incorporates a Random Delay feature. This feature introduces a random extension of time for initiating transfers. By enabling multiple transfers to commence simultaneously or at approximately the same time, it prevents adversaries from deducing transaction information by comparing initiation and arrival times. The Random Delay feature adds an extra layer of protection to ensure transaction privacy and security.

It's important to note that the Random Delay feature is optional, giving users the flexibility to deselect it if they find the wait time to be too long. This empowers users to have more control over their transaction process while still maintaining privacy.
